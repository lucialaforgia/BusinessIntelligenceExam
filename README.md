## Abstract
This repository contains a project for my Business Intelligence course.

Since the spread of the online marketplace, people have become comfortable with the habit of buying clothing online. On this line, our survey nails at finding how this relates to the Luxury market in the Fashion Industry.
The Luxury market has always been oriented towards purchases in physical shops but, however to a lesser extent, lately, it has been influenced by a move towards online shopping. In particular, in the last three years and especially during 2020 Pandemic, the online marketplace saw an unchallenged increase.
According to Italia Online, “E-commerce represents a huge opportunity for the luxury sector. Not only has it enabled many companies to survive during the lockdown, but it is also a key channel for recovery. Globally, online sales of luxury goods will increase until 2025, partly replacing physical shops”.
More specifically, the main goal of this survey is to understand if our audience is interested in shopping luxury goods and what are their preferences over its purchase methods, in particular if online distribution channels can become the most popular new frontier.
